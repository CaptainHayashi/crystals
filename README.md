Test Suite
==========

The module loader comes with a test suite, which depends on valgrind. Build and run it with the following:

    make tests

You should get output similar to the following:

    % make tests
    Compiling test suite:
    
    Running test suite:
    Loading 'test' module
    Loading module: /home/barrucadu/projects/crystals/tests/modules/test.so
    test init: Module test has been loaded!
    Loading 'foo' module
    Loading module: /home/barrucadu/projects/crystals/tests/modules/foo.so
    (null)
    ./tests/module: undefined symbol: init
    ./tests/module: undefined symbol: term
    ./tests/module: undefined symbol: bar
    Testing 'test' module:
        Should be hello world: Hello, world.
        2 + 3 = 5
    test term: Module test has been unloaded!
    
    Running memory leak check:
    ==1113==    definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
    ==1113==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
    ==1113==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks

If you get a segfault or something, you can use GDB:

    gdb -ex run -ex backtrace --args ./tests/module

If there is a memory leak, you can use valgrind:

    valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes ./tests/module
