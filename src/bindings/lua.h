 *
 * @param lua_State Pass the the lua state that holds the stack.
 * @param func_name The name of the function. To be displayed in error messages.
 * @param sig       A string of chars which defines how many and of which types
 * the paramaters should be. Add 's' for string, 'd' for number, 't' for a table
 * and 'b' for boolean.
 * (e.g.: "sdd" = 3 paramters, 1th stirng, 2nd numebr, 3rd number)
 *
 * @return Return SUCCESS if the values in the stack match the sig, eles return
 * FAILURE. (defined in "util.h")
 *
 * @todo Add more type checks if nessecary.
