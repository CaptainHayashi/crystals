 *  @brief   Prototypes and declarations for rendering functions.
 *
 *  The map renderer makes a distinction between the map data itself 
 *  and the additional data set tracking the map viewpoint.  Whereas 
 *  functions and structures related to the former are available in 
 *  map.c and map.h, the map viewpoint system is described in this 
 *  and mapview.c.
