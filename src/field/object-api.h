 * TOP_LEFT sets the co-ordinates to refer to the top-left of the
 * image.  BOTTOM_LEFT sets the co-ordinates to refer to the
 * bottom-left of the image, which in most cases will represent the
 * actual physical "base" of the object.
 *
 * @param object_name  Name to the object to move.
 *
 * @param x            The x co-ordinate, representing the left edge

 *                     the map.

 *                     BOTTOM_LEFT). In most cases, BOTTOM_LEFT is
 *                     preferred, as the bottom of the image is the
