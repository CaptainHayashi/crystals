 * @brief   Public interface for the map view system.
 *
 * The map renderer makes a distinction between the map data itself
 * and the additional data set tracking the map viewpoint.  Whereas
 * functions and structures related to the former are available in
 * map.c and map.h, the map viewpoint system is described in this
 * and mapview.c.
