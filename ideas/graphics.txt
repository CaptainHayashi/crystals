- SDL based

- I would personally go for 640x480 native resolution, with probably some work
  later to work for native resolutions.

- Unsure on whether to use 8 bits per pixel or 24/32.

- Personally, I would prefer 2D pixel-art style spriting, but would be OK with 
  2D renders of 3D so long as the render lighting is consistent and the models 
  are of good quality.

- I would be happy doing basic graphics coding and a few sprites, but cannot
  do animations.
