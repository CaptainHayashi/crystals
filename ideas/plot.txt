RobDonkey's ideas, of which I agree with or would be OK with:

- Have, eg in the place of *mon gyms, "covens" or groups of summon-users 
  of a certain type (eg forest spirits, etc). Each coven has an element 
  of an item required to get entrance into a cave renowned for its 
  AMAZING TREASURES, or maybe something beyond the player's wildest dreams. 
  Therefore, the main plot isn't about saving the world or anything, but 
  personal gain (a bit like the original *mons). [Strongly agree.]

Own ideas:

- There could be a personal reason for finding this treasure (to help 
  poor family or something) or maybe even a choice of reasons.

- Maybe there could be room for some background, for people who seek it, 
  and this could incorporate some of the background story ideas going 
  around. (A bit like how some games have in-game books on history and 
  such.)
