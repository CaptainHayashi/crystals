I strongly for xml as file format for levels, maps or whathever we will call
it, because I used already xml and wrote some parsers for it, and there are
also methods to make xml documents more strict. In my old game I used xml for 
almost everything.

The file idea.map.xml is from my previous game, don't mind the german-english
mix.
