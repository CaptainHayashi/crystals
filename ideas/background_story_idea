********** gtklocker's background story idea for Crystals  **********
* Peace on planet
* Bad monster came, brougth many other monsters.
* Suddenly, ice came above them. They got trapped.
* People were sure they won't attack them again.
* Few years later they noticed that they can use the trapped monsters to fight!
* They needed to fight new enemies, bad enemies. Other giant monsters that went there to steal everything.
* (scenes in snow, probably)
* Giant drills, kicks, the power that people were keeping, helped them to enhance the abilities of the monsters.
* They believed in theirselfs. They went straightly to fight.
* After many months, they finally got their land back, they won the monsters.
