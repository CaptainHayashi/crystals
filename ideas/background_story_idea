Therer was once peace on the planet AAA. Then a bad powerfull monster came, 
which also brought magic and more monster with him. A time of war and fear 
came and the planet was ruled by the monsters. But the humans too learned how
to use the magic brought by the monster and they found a method to trap the 
monsters in crystals and they could ban the monsters from the planet. The 
humans buried the crystals on different places all over the planet, so that 
nobody can every awake the monsters from their slumber. 

But the magic remained on that planet and some longed to crontrolled that power,
but they noticed that humans can not fully utilise that power. Only the monsters
could fully make use of magic. That lead to people which began to search for the
monsters, because also humans wanted to have power to rule the planet.

After many years people did not find any crystals and it began to become a myth, 
but then a man found a gem and awoke a monster, but the monters were trapped to 
long on the planet and they're are neither bad nor good anymore, they now react 
to the emotions of their owners, but some used force to make those monster more
argessiv.
